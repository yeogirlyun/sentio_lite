## Analysis

### What Changed:
1. ✅ **Rank-based rotation implemented** - 76 rotations on Oct 17 alone
2. ✅ **Rotation cooldowns added** - prevents immediate re-entry
3. ✅ **Min hold period increased** - 5 bars → 20 bars
4. ✅ **Find weakest position logic** - correctly identifies weakest signals

### Key Issues Identified:

#### 1. **Too Many Rotations** (76/day on Oct 17)
- **Cause:** `rotation_strength_delta = 0.002` (20 bps) is too small
- **Effect:** Excessive churning - rotating almost every bar
- **Evidence:** Oct 17 had 76 rotation events in 391 bars = 19% rotation rate!
- **Fix:** Increase to `0.005` (50 bps) or `0.01` (100 bps)

#### 2. **Direction Not Considered**
Current logic rotates based on ABSOLUTE signal strength:
```cpp
// CURRENT: Using absolute values
double weakest_strength = std::abs(predictions.at(weakest).prediction.pred_5bar.prediction);
double candidate_strength = std::abs(ranked[i].second);
```

**Problem:** Rotating from LONG → SHORT or vice versa is not a rotation, it's a signal reversal!

**Example:**
- Holding TQQQ (LONG, strength: 50 bps)
- See SQQQ (SHORT, strength: 80 bps)
- Current logic: "Rotate!" (30 bps delta)
- **Reality:** These are OPPOSITE signals!

**Fix:** Only rotate if signals have the SAME direction:
```cpp
bool same_direction = (weakest_pred > 0 && candidate_pred > 0) ||
                     (weakest_pred < 0 && candidate_pred < 0);
if (!same_direction) continue;  // Don't rotate opposite directions
```

#### 3. **Trade Count Still Fixed** (~104/day)
Despite rotation logic, we still see ~104 trades per day. This suggests:
- Time-based exits (min_bars_to_hold = 20) still dominating
- Rotation adding MORE trades, not replacing time-based exits
- **Expected:** Fewer trades with signal-driven exits
- **Actual:** Same trades + rotations on top

#### 4. **Win Rate Declined**
- Before: 11.5-13.5% win rate
- After: 8.7-12.5% win rate
- **Cause:** More trades = more losses from excessive rotation

## Recommended Fixes

### Priority 1: Increase Rotation Threshold
```cpp
// In multi_symbol_trader.h
double rotation_strength_delta = 0.01;   // Was 0.002 - increase to 100 bps
```

### Priority 2: Add Direction Check
```cpp
// In make_trades(), before rotation check:
double weakest_pred = predictions.at(weakest).prediction.pred_5bar.prediction;
double candidate_pred = pred_data.prediction.pred_5bar.prediction;

// Only rotate if signals have same direction
bool same_direction = (weakest_pred > 0 && candidate_pred > 0) ||
                     (weakest_pred < 0 && candidate_pred < 0);
if (!same_direction) {
    continue;  // Don't rotate opposite directions - that's a signal reversal!
}
```

### Priority 3: Reduce Time-Based Exits
The root issue is still that **time dominates over signal quality**. Even with rotation logic, positions are exiting after 20 bars regardless.

**Solution:** Disable automatic exit after `typical_hold_period`:
```cpp
// In trade_filter.cpp - REMOVE or modify adaptive exit threshold
// Lines 97-109: This forces exits as we approach typical_hold_period
```

### Priority 4: Track Rotation Metrics
Add to trading results:
- Number of rotations
- Average rotation delta
- Rotation success rate (did rotated-in position perform better?)

## Next Steps

1. **Increase rotation delta to 100 bps** (0.01)
2. **Add direction check** to prevent LONG/SHORT rotations
3. **Test again on Oct 13-17**
4. **Compare rotation count and performance**

Expected outcome:
- Fewer rotations (10-20 instead of 76)
- Better win rate (quality over quantity)
- More variable trade counts (signal-driven)
