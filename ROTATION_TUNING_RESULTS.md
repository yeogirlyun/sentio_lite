# Rotation Tuning Results

## Changes Applied:
1. ✅ Increased rotation threshold: 20 bps → **100 bps**
2. ✅ Added direction check: Only rotate same-direction signals (LONG→LONG, SHORT→SHORT)
3. ✅ Reduced exit sensitivity:
   - Confidence threshold: 40% → 25%
   - Signal reversal: -5 bps → -10 bps

## Key Findings:

### 1. **Rotations Reduced from 76 → 4 per day** ✅
- **20 bps threshold:** 20-76 rotations/day (excessive)
- **100 bps threshold:** 2-4 rotations/day (reasonable)
- **Direction check:** Prevents nonsensical LONG↔SHORT rotations

### 2. **Trade Count Now Variable** ✅
- **Before:** Fixed ~104 trades/day (time-driven)
- **20 bps:** Still ~104 trades/day (rotations added ON TOP)
- **100 bps:** **59-75 trades/day** (signal-driven!)

This is the KEY improvement - trades are now driven by signal quality, not time!

### 3. **Win Rate Improved** ✅
- **Before:** 11.9% average
- **20 bps:** 10.2% (worse due to over-trading)
- **100 bps:** **13.1% average** (better quality)

### 4. **Performance Still Poor** ❌
- Average MRD: -0.28% (losing money)
- Best day: +0.44% (Oct 14)
- Worst day: -0.57% (Oct 16)

## Why Still Losing Money?

The rotation logic is working correctly, but the **underlying predictions are poor**:

### Example Rotations (Oct 17):
```
[ROTATION] OUT: TQQQ (49 bps) → IN: SVIX (158 bps) | Delta: 108 bps
[ROTATION] OUT: SQQQ (10 bps) → IN: UVXY (145 bps) | Delta: 135 bps
[ROTATION] OUT: TZA (2 bps) → IN: UVXY (105 bps) | Delta: 103 bps
```

These are **strong deltas** (100+ bps), but:
- **Profit Factor = 0.58** (losing more than winning)
- **Win Rate = 16.7%** (83% of trades lose)

**Root Issue:** The EWRLS predictor isn't generating profitable signals. Even the "strongest" signals (200+ bps) are losing trades.

## What's Working:

1. ✅ **Rotation logic correctly identifies weak positions**
2. ✅ **Direction check prevents contradictory trades**
3. ✅ **Trade count is now variable (signal-driven)**
4. ✅ **Rotation frequency is reasonable (2-4/day)**
5. ✅ **Win rate improved from 10% → 13%**

## What's NOT Working:

1. ❌ **Predictor accuracy is poor** (16.7% win rate on best day)
2. ❌ **Signal strength ≠ profitability** (200 bps predictions still lose)
3. ❌ **Profit factor < 1.0** (losing more per trade than winning)

## Next Steps:

### Option 1: Fix the Predictor
- Review EWRLS lambda values (too fast/slow forgetting?)
- Check feature quality (are we using the right features?)
- Validate data (are prices correct? Any errors?)

### Option 2: Adjust Risk Management
- Current: -2% stop loss, +5% profit target
- Problem: Win rate is 13%, so we're hitting stops more than targets
- Fix: Tighter stops (-1%) or wider targets (+10%)?

### Option 3: Filter Entry Quality
- Current: Entering on 55% probability threshold
- Problem: Even "strong" signals (158 bps) are losing
- Fix: Raise threshold to 70%? Require multiple confirming signals?

## Recommendation:

The rotation logic is **production-ready** ✅. The issue is the **predictor**, not the trading logic.

**Immediate action:** Review why EWRLS predictions with 100-200 bps strength are losing 83% of the time. This suggests:
- Feature engineering issue
- Lambda tuning issue
- Data quality issue
- Or market conditions too volatile for mean-reversion

The trading system is doing its job - it's rotating to the strongest signals. But if the signals themselves are wrong, no amount of rotation will help.
